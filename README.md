# Scrolly Story Generator

This project allows you to create a scrollytelling story using data from a spreadsheet

A scrollytelling story is an web page where some text scrolls down while other content remains "sticky," by staying on the page at the same position until you're ready to replace it with a different piece of "sticky" content. It allows you to focus on the sticky content and explain to the user what they might focus on to illustrate what the story is telling them.

This project is configured to create an example story here: [[Pages URL](https://danschreibersiue.github.io/scrolly-story-from-csv/)]
