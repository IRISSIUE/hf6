# Scrolly Story Generator

This project allows you to create a scrollytelling story using data from a spreadsheet.

A scrollytelling story is a web page where some text scrolls to tell a story while other content (such as images, maps, or videos), remain "sticky" and stay in the same position on the page to illustrate the text that's currently in view. As text scrolls down the page, the sticky content changes to illustrate the story being told.

This project creates a sample [Scrolly Story](https://danschreibersiue.github.io/scrolly-story-from-csv/) and instructs you on how to create your own.
